      <h3> CSS: Introduction</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>What is a CSS rule, declaration and property?</li>
        <p> A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:
          <img src="beginner-bootcamp/HTML-CSS-Cleancode/images/cssintro.jpg" alt="CSS Rule" style="width:170px;height:36px;">
          A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>

        <li>How do you use inline, internal or external css? Why would you prefer one over the other?</li>
        <p> With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file! Each page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the < link > element.

        Internal styles are defined within the < style > element, inside the <  head > section of an HTML.

        To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

        The inline style (inside a specific HTML element) has the highest priority, which means that it will override a style defined inside the < head > tag, or in an external style sheet, or a browser default value.</p>

        <li>What is cascading? What does and what doesn't cascade?</li>
        <p> Cascading Style Sheets or CSS are set up so that you can have many properties all affecting the same element. Some of those properties may conflict with one another. For example, you might set a font color of red on the paragraph tag and then, later on, set a font color of blue. How does the browser know which color to make the paragraphs? This is decided by the cascade.</p>

        <li>What is a relative file path? What would you use it for?</li>
        <p>A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page. When using relative file paths,  web pages will not be bound to the current base URL. All links will work on the computer (localhost) as well as on the current public domain and the future public domains.</p>
